Greetings Player,

Thank you for taking your time to play my game. This is an educational farming simulation game focused on monocropping issues.

Of all the published serious/educational games, there are only around 2 to 3 games that are based on agriculture.

Agriculture is an important aspect of everyday living. Therefore, people need proper awareness about this harmful practice, which could evetually destroy the agricultural lands and their ecosystems, resulting an impact on its dependants (living creatures).

Hence this game is built in an attempt to spread awareness about monocropping among people across globe and generations.

This Game is designed as accurate as possible with data obtained from various research articles and legitimate sites.

Let's begin with some history!!!
