  _itemDescription: A greenhouse (also called a glasshouse, or, if with sufficient
    heating, a hothouse) is a structure with walls and roof made chiefly of transparent
    material, such as glass, in which plants requiring regulated climatic conditions
    are grown. These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized
    buildings. A miniature greenhouse is known as a cold frame. The interior of a
    greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes significantly warmer than the external
    temperature, protecting its contents in cold weather.
