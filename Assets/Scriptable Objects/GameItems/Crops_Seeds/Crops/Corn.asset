  _itemDescription: Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated
    by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk
    of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences
    called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits.
